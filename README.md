Real-Time Giotto Integration with WSNs for Improved UAV Localization

Overview
The intent is to enhance UAV localization accuracy by integrating wireless sensor network (WSN) data with Giotto, a time-triggered programming paradigm for precise control in UAVs. WSNs compensate for GPS signal interference in dense or land-locked terrains. Giotto's Embedded Machine (EM) supervises software tasks based on physical events. Pre-defined localization algorithms, such as Gauss-Newton, are tested with WSN data in Matlab to improve localization accuracy. Anchor nodes of WSN clusters communicate with Giotto to refine UAV location. Integration involves wireless or custom RF protocols for WSN-Giotto communication. Giotto interprets input from WSN and subsequently updates actuator ports with refined position, enhancing overall system accuracy.


Usage
    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Giotto code has to be run with the Giotto Development Kit (GDK). Giotto code given here is partial accounting only for the communication part.
    Install MATLAB and run the simulation.
    Report any issues or feedback by opening an issue on the GitHub repository.
